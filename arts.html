<h4>Intellectual Arts</h4>
    <p>Learning in New Jersey is mandatory. People do have the option of being homeschooled, but their learning must be equivalent to what the student would normally learn in a public or private school. However, at the age of 16 students can drop out of school if they choose. There are programs for students who drop out including night schooling options at normal high schools. Sports are also a big part of the New Jersey lifestyle. Soccer, football, and hockey are the most popular sports in New Jersey.</p>
